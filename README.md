simple-conference-dthack2013
============================

Application made in 24 hours at Evernote & Deutsche Telekom hackaton april 2013 by [@speedrcr](https://github.com/speedracr) (design) and [@mcveat](https://github.com/mcveat/) (code).

Hack to make conference calling better. Drop necessary information on the form and let the magic happen:
 * agenda is saved to Evernote and shared by email with all recipients
 * call is made _(in the real world it should be scheudled, but because of 24h constraint we went for console where you can fire the call by yourself, go to */console* to check it)_

Results can be seen on http://simple-conf.herokuapp.com/ and calls are possible as long as there is credit on our account (not long).
